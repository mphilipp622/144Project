This program should be run in Cygwin64 on Windows. Cygwin will need to have G++ compiler and the GNU Make packages installed. This program should also be able to run in a Unix environment as long as G++ and GNU Make are installed, however, I have only tested it in Cygwin64.

This stackoverflow post describes how to get the make package installed in a cygwin environment if it is not installed already: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17710209/how-to-run-make-from-cygwin-environment

Additionally, C++11 must be available in the Cygwin environment. This should be standard with the G++ installation, to my knowledge.

To compile and run the program, you can use the CompileAndRun.sh file by executing the following command within the root directory of the project:

./CompileAndRun.sh TP TC

where TP is the max time interval for producers and TC is the max time interval for consumers. The script will run a make command to compile the program and then execute it with the arguments you passed to the shell script.

All header files can be found in the "headers" folder. All cpp files can be found in the "source" folder.
